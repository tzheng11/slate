# Introduction

Welcome to ZenProspect's sales development university! In this guide, you'll

learn how to generate demos from scratch.

# Understand your ICP

You need to do your homework if you want to get responses:

1. **Understand your buyer persona** — are they VP Sales, VP Marketing, HR, CEOs, etc? Do they work at Fortune 500 Companies, or at startups? Go here to check out how you can use ZenProspect's tools to do it!
   
2. **Think carefully about your prospect’s pain points**, and how your business solves them. Are they trying to scale their sales? Are they trying to fight churn?
   
3. **Research Competitors** — What’s your competition doing? Do they have useful messaging that you could repackage to use for your own campaign? Look at their websites and sign up to their mailing list with an alternate email to collect research.

## Make your best guess

I guessed that ZenProspect has two main buyer personas. 

1. ZenProspect's primary buyer persona are those looking to build up outbound
   
   - Title: Founder, CEO, VP of Sales (if they've done mostly inbound and are looking to build up outbound)
   - Vertical: Enterprise Software
   - Company Size: 1-10 employees, 11-50
   - Other attributes: Currently has 5-100 customers, mostly through inbound, referrals, random, etc.
   - Business neeed: Looking to **build** up outbound.
   
2. ZenProspect secondary buyer persona are those looking to scale up outbound
   
   - Role: Whoever is in charge of SDRs
   - Title: sales development director, sales development manager, sales director, VP of Sales, Demand Gen
   - Vertical: Enterprise Software
   - Company Size: 11-50, 51-200
   - Other attributes: Currently has a template that's generating some responses.
